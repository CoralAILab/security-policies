title: Device Baseline Audit Procedure (SEC-PROC-017)

---

### 1. Purpose

To conduct a comprehensive quarterly audit of all endpoint devices against security baselines, ensuring sustained compliance with HITRUST controls and identifying devices requiring immediate remediation due to multiple critical policy failures.

### 2. Scope

This procedure applies to all company-owned or managed endpoints (macOS and Windows devices) enrolled in the FleetDM endpoint management platform. It covers the quarterly deep-dive assessment of all 32 FleetDM security policies, baseline drift detection, and generation of audit evidence for compliance reviews.

### 3. Overview

This procedure outlines the quarterly process for conducting a comprehensive device baseline audit using FleetDM. Unlike the monthly compliance report (SEC-PROC-016) which focuses on category-level compliance rates, this procedure performs a device-level analysis to identify endpoints that fail multiple critical policies and may pose elevated security risk. It generates audit evidence suitable for SEC-PROC-002 (Internal Audit) and SEC-PROC-013 (Independent Security Review).

### 4. Procedure

| **Step** | **Who**                      | **What**                                                                                                                            |
| -------- | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1**    | Security Team (Automated)    | Execute `/fleet-compliance --mode quarterly` skill to query FleetDM API for comprehensive device and policy compliance data.        |
| **2**    | Security Team (Automated)    | Audit all 32 FleetDM policies (19 critical, 13 standard) across the entire device fleet.                                            |
| **3**    | Security Team (Automated)    | Identify devices failing 3 or more critical policies; flag for immediate remediation.                                               |
| **4**    | Security Team (Automated)    | Detect baseline configuration drift by comparing current state against expected baseline values.                                    |
| **5**    | Security Team (Automated)    | Create Linear tickets for devices requiring remediation (devices failing 3+ critical policies).                                     |
| **6**    | Security Team (Automated)    | Generate HITRUST evidence report mapping compliance status to controls 10.a, 09.ab, and 06.h.                                       |
| **7**    | Security Team                | Review audit findings and prioritize remediation efforts based on risk assessment.                                                   |
| **8**    | IT Department                | Perform remediation on flagged devices; critical devices must be remediated within 48 hours.                                        |
| **9**    | Security Team                | Execute `/fleet-compliance --mode drift` to verify baseline drift has been corrected post-remediation.                              |
| **10**   | Security Team                | Archive evidence report for quarterly compliance review and annual audit preparation.                                                |

### 5. Standards Compliance

| Control | Framework | Description |

See [Annex: Control Mapping](../_annexes/control_mapping.md) for complete mapping.

### 6. Artifact(s)

- Quarterly Device Baseline Audit Report (generated by `/fleet-compliance --mode quarterly`)
- HITRUST Evidence Report (generated by `/fleet-compliance --mode evidence`)
- Linear tickets for devices requiring remediation (auto-created for devices failing 3+ critical policies)
- Baseline Drift Report (generated by `/fleet-compliance --mode drift`)

### 7. Definitions

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Baseline** | The expected security configuration state for a device, defined by FleetDM policies |
| **Baseline Drift** | Deviation from expected configuration state, detected by comparing current vs. expected values |
| **Critical Policy** | A FleetDM policy marked as critical (19 total), typically covering encryption, firewall, and core security controls |
| **Standard Policy** | A FleetDM policy marked as standard (13 total), covering additional security hardening |
| **Device-Level Analysis** | Assessment focused on individual devices rather than aggregate policy compliance rates |

See [Annex: Glossary](../_annexes/glossary.md) for additional terms.
