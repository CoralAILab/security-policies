### 1. Purpose

To provide a systematic, monthly review of endpoint compliance status across all enrolled devices using FleetDM, ensuring that security configurations remain in accordance with organizational baseline requirements and HITRUST controls.

### 2. Scope

This procedure applies to all company-owned or managed endpoints (macOS and Windows devices) enrolled in the FleetDM endpoint management platform. It covers the monthly assessment of compliance with security policies including disk encryption, firewall configuration, antivirus status, and baseline security settings.

### 3. Overview

This procedure outlines the monthly process for generating and reviewing endpoint compliance reports from FleetDM. It includes automated data collection from the FleetDM API, compliance rate calculation across policy categories, identification of non-compliant devices, and threshold-based ticket creation for remediation tracking. The procedure supports HITRUST control 10.a (Security requirements analysis) and 09.ab (Monitoring system use).

### 4. Procedure

| **Step** | **Who**                      | **What**                                                                                                                            |
| -------- | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1**    | Security Team (Automated)    | Execute `/fleet-compliance --mode monthly` skill to query FleetDM API for current device enrollment and policy compliance status.   |
| **2**    | Security Team (Automated)    | Calculate compliance rates by category: encryption, firewall, antivirus, and baseline configurations.                               |
| **3**    | Security Team (Automated)    | Compare compliance rates against 90% threshold; create Linear tickets for any category falling below threshold.                     |
| **4**    | Security Team (Automated)    | Generate monthly compliance report including trends, non-compliant device list, and HITRUST control mapping.                        |
| **5**    | Security Team                | Review generated report and validate identified non-compliant devices.                                                               |
| **6**    | IT Department                | Perform remediation actions on non-compliant devices within defined SLAs (Critical: 48 hours, High: 7 days, Medium: 30 days).       |
| **7**    | Security Team                | Verify remediation by re-running compliance check; close associated tickets upon successful verification.                           |
| **8**    | Security Team                | Archive compliance report as evidence for audit purposes per SEC-PROC-002 (Internal Audit Procedure).                               |

### 5. Standards Compliance

| Control | Framework | Description |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| 10.a | HITRUST CSF v11.5.0 | Security requirements analysis and specification |
| 09.ab | HITRUST CSF v11.5.0 | Monitoring system use |
| 06.h | HITRUST CSF v11.5.0 | Technical compliance checking |
| 164.308(a)(1) | HIPAA | Security Management Process |
| 164.310(d)(1) | HIPAA | Device and Media Controls |

See [Annex: Control Mapping](../_annexes/control_mapping.md) for complete mapping.

### 6. Artifact(s)

- Monthly FleetDM Compliance Report (generated by `/fleet-compliance --mode monthly`)
- Linear tickets for non-compliant categories (auto-created when compliance < 90%)
- Evidence export for audit purposes (generated by `/fleet-compliance --mode evidence`)

### 7. Definitions

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Compliance Rate** | Percentage of enrolled devices passing a specific policy or policy category |
| **Compliance Threshold** | Minimum acceptable compliance rate (default: 90%) below which remediation tickets are created |
| **FleetDM** | Endpoint security management platform used to monitor and enforce security policies via osquery |
| **osquery** | Open-source endpoint agent that enables SQL-based queries of device state |

See [Annex: Glossary](../_annexes/glossary.md) for additional terms.

### 8. Responsibilities

| **Role**          | **Responsibility**                                                                                             |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Security Team** | Responsible for executing monthly compliance checks, reviewing reports, and verifying remediation completion.   |
| **IT Department** | Responsible for remediating non-compliant devices within defined SLAs.                                          |
| **Asset Owner**   | Responsible for ensuring assigned devices comply with security policies.                                        |

### 9. Automation

This procedure is automated via the `/fleet-compliance` Claude skill.

**Automation Command:**
```
/fleet-compliance --mode monthly --create-tickets
```

**Automation Capabilities:**
- Queries FleetDM API for device and policy compliance data
- Calculates compliance rates by category
- Auto-creates Linear tickets when compliance drops below 90% threshold
- Generates formatted compliance reports

**Automation Frequency:** Monthly (executed via `/scheduled-tasks` skill)

**Manual Override:** Security Team may execute `/fleet-compliance` at any time for ad-hoc compliance checks.
