This annex consolidates and standardizes definitions used across the ISMS policy and procedure set. Individual documents should reference this annex instead of including their own glossary sections.

How to use:
- When a term is needed in a document, link to this annex section using a relative link.
- Keep terms plain, vendor-neutral, and adaptable.

## Terms

- Access Review: A periodic or event-driven evaluation of user entitlements to verify they remain appropriate for role and business need.
- Account Lifecycle: The end-to-end process of user account creation, modification, review, and termination aligned with employment status and role changes.
- Audit Logging Framework: The coordinated system of policies, procedures, and technologies that support logging across domains (authentication/network, data access, etc.).
- Authentication Event: A security event related to verifying the identity of a user, device, or service attempting to access a system or resource.
- Authorization Event: A security event related to granting or denying access permissions to authenticated entities based on their privileges and roles.
- Business Associate Agreement (BAA): A HIPAA-required contract between a covered entity and a business associate defining permitted uses/disclosures of ePHI and safeguards.
- BYOD (Bring Your Own Device): A practice that allows workforce members to use personal devices for work-related purposes subject to security controls.
- Cell Suppression: The practice of not displaying statistical results when the underlying count is below a minimum threshold to prevent identification of individuals in de-identified datasets.
- Clean Desk Policy: Practice requiring sensitive materials to be secured when workspaces are unattended.
- Cloud Service Provider: A third-party organization providing cloud computing services, including infrastructure, platforms, or software.
- Cross-Domain Correlation: The process of analyzing and linking related events across authentication, network, and data access logging domains.
- Data Lifecycle Management: Managing data from creation through retention, archiving, and secure destruction.
- Data Loss Prevention (DLP): Technology and processes that detect and prevent unauthorized transmission or use of sensitive data.
- De-identification: The process of removing specified identifiers from ePHI such that the remaining information cannot reasonably identify an individual, as defined by HIPAA (45 CFR § 164.514). See SEC-POL-014 for requirements.
- De-identified Data: Information that has been processed to remove identifiers in accordance with the HIPAA Safe Harbor method and is no longer considered ePHI or PHI under HIPAA.
- Electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI): Individually identifiable health information that is created, stored, transmitted, or maintained electronically.
- Environmental Controls: Systems and procedures designed to protect against environmental hazards such as fire, flood, temperature extremes, and power failures.
- Event Integration: The technical capability to combine and analyze security events from multiple specialized logging domains.
- Identity and Access Management (IAM): Policies, processes, and technologies used to manage digital identities and control access to resources based on user roles and responsibilities.
- Information Owner: Individual with authority and responsibility for specific information, including establishing handling requirements and approving access.
- Information Security Management System (ISMS): A systematic approach to managing sensitive company information to keep it secure, including policies, procedures, and controls.
- Least Privilege: The principle of restricting access rights to the minimum permissions needed to perform work.
- Mobile Device Management (MDM): Software that enables an organization to secure, monitor, and manage mobile devices used for business purposes.
- Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): A security process requiring two or more authentication factors (e.g., password plus token/biometric) for access verification.
- Network Flow: A sequence of packets from a source to a destination that share common characteristics such as IP addresses, ports, and protocols.
- No Actual Knowledge: A HIPAA standard requiring that the person certifying de-identification is not aware of any information that could be used, alone or in combination with other reasonably available information, to identify an individual who is a subject of the data. See SEC-POL-014 for documentation requirements.
- Privileged Access: Elevated administrative or system-level access that can modify configurations, security settings, or data beyond standard user capabilities.
- Privilege Escalation: Gaining elevated access permissions beyond those initially granted to a user or service account.
- Quasi-identifier: A data element that is not a direct identifier but could contribute to re-identification when combined with other information (e.g., age, gender, diagnosis, geographic region). See SEC-POL-014 for statistical disclosure controls.
- Remote Lock: Administrative action that remotely makes a device inaccessible.
- Remote Wipe: Administrative action that remotely deletes data from a device.
- Risk Assessment: The process of identifying vulnerabilities and threats to information assets and determining the risk posed by those threats.
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): A method of restricting access based on user roles aligned to job functions.
- Safe Harbor Method: A de-identification standard specified in HIPAA (45 CFR § 164.514(b)(2)) that requires removal of 18 specified identifiers and no actual knowledge that remaining information could identify an individual.
- Security Incident: Any event that could result in unauthorized access, disclosure, modification, or destruction of information assets.
- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM): Technology providing real-time analysis and correlation of security alerts and events from multiple sources.
- Session Correlation: Linking related authentication and access events across multiple systems using session identifiers.
- System Owner: The individual or group responsible for the procurement, development, operation, and maintenance of an information system.
- Synthetic Data: Artificially generated data that mimics the statistical properties of real data but contains no actual patient information. Required for testing and development per SEC-POL-014.
- Tailgating: Unauthorized access gained by following an authorized person through a controlled physical access point.
- Threat Intelligence: Information about current and potential security threats used to enhance detection and response.
- User Agent: Information about the client software, operating system, and device characteristics used for requests such as authentication.
- SOC 2 Report: A report on controls at a service organization relevant to security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, or privacy.
